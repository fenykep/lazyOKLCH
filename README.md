# lazyOKLCH

![layzOKLCH widget](lazyOKCLH.png)

This is a really lazy implementation of an OKLCH color picker.
A mouse hoovering over the component controls the lightness and chroma
values, but if you keep the mouse pressed it does not change the value.
Also if you click on the component it prints out the current value to the
console in json, but hopefully I will change it later to copy to clipboard
as hex or something.

And scrolling over the component changes the hue (warping around).

Right-click toggles monochrome.
